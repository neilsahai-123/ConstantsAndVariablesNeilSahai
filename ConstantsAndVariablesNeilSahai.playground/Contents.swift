//Experiment 1

let placeOfBirth = "New York"
var placeOfLive = "Sydney"
var age = 35
var favMovie = "Avenger"
let inchesInFoot = 12
let firstPresidentOfUS = "George Washington"


print(placeOfBirth)
print(placeOfLive)

print(favMovie)

//Experiment 2
//Below, add a line of code that assigns a new value to currentLocation:

var currentLocation = "New Jersey"

//Assigning new value

currentLocation = "New York"
print(currentLocation)


//Experiment 3: Working with variables

var score = 0
//: If the player scores ten points, you can update the score:

score = score + 5 //increase score count

print(score)


score += 10 //Shortcut for sum.

print(score)

score = score + score

print(score)



//Experiment 4: Shortcut for string assignment
//Try building up the statement ‚ÄúCompound assignment is useful‚Äù using compound assignment and the following constants. The first part of the statement is done for you:


let word1 = "Compound"
let word2 = "assignment"
let word3 = "is"
let word4 = "useful"
let space = " "

//Ans

let completeSentence = word1 + space + word2 + space + word3 + space + word4

print(completeSentence)


//Experiment 5: Let vs Var usage
var friendBeverageChoice = "coffee"
//Instead of var we can use let to restrict friend to select specific beverage

friendBeverageChoice = "water"
